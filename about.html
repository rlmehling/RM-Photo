          <p>From the early age of 10, Rebecca knew she had a love for photography. 
            She constantly had a camera in her hand, venturing out in the small woods of Southern Indiana 
            with her siblings to capture images of anything she could. She continued in high school photographing 
            landscapes and scenes from the farm she lived on for 4-H projects every summer. 
            This grew into realizing she wanted to pursue a career in photography.
            She started at Indiana University pursing a degree in Studio Art and Journalism, specifically 
            focusing in photojournalism and photography. She graduated in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts 
            in Journalism with a second major in Studio Art. While attending IU she photographed for the Indiana Daily Student, 
            the university's newspaper. Throughout her senior year she was photo editor of the entire paper, 
            covering events, in-depth stories and breaking news. After graduating she gained experience interning 
            with Indiana University Athletics for the Mark Cuban Center for Media Technology, where she trained in 
            studio portraits, lighting, and sports action photography. Rebecca then moved to Pittsburgh, PA where she had 
            the opportunity to intern with the Pittsburgh Steelers as a Photographer, helping cover games, community events and more. 
            While currently taking a break from photographing full time, Rebecca still enjoys freelancing in the Pittsburgh area. 
            She is also currently working towards another bachelorâ€™s degree in Web Design.</p>
